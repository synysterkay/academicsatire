Whether you want to discuss speaking engagements, share your own academic absurdity stories, or just say hello—I'd love to hear from you.

## Response Time

I try to respond to all emails within 3-5 business days. If you don't hear back, it's probably because I'm trapped in a meeting about meetings.

*P.S. If your email is about why a character in my book seems suspiciously similar to someone you know, I can neither confirm nor deny anything.*
