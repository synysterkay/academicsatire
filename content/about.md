## The Short Version

I write books that make academics nervous and readers happy. My specialty? Taking the beautiful absurdity of higher education and turning it into comedy gold.

When I'm not writing, I'm probably attending a meeting that could have been an email, judging people's font choices, or contemplating why faculty parking is treated like the Hunger Games.

## The Slightly Longer Version

Once upon a time, I was a bright-eyed academic who believed that the life of the mind was the highest calling. I was going to change the world through education, inspire generations, and maybe—just maybe—finally understand what "synergy" means.

Then I attended my first faculty meeting.

Forty-seven meetings later (yes, I counted), I realized that my true calling wasn't explaining Foucault to undergraduates who hadn't done the reading. It was making people laugh about the fact that we're all trapped in a system where discussing parking lot allocation is considered productive use of a PhD.

### Why Satire?

Because the truth is funnier than fiction, and academic life is stranger than both.

Every absurd scenario in my books is based on real experiences. The faculty meeting about the proper way to announce faculty meetings? Real. The email chain that lasted six months over a semicolon? Absolutely real. The professor who cited themselves 47 times in a single paper? You guessed it—real.

I write satire because it's the only reasonable response to a world where people spend more time formatting their works cited page than actually citing works.

### The Philosophy

> "If you can't fix it, feature it. If you can't feature it, make fun of it. If you can't make fun of it, you're probably in a committee meeting."
> 
> — Academic Satire, during a committee meeting

My goal is simple: to make you laugh, make you think, and make you feel less alone in whatever institutional absurdity you're currently navigating.

Whether you're a tenured professor wondering where the years went, a grad student questioning your life choices, or just someone who's curious what really happens in the ivory tower—there's something here for you.
