Let's be honest. **Coffee Addiction & Morning Rage** is something we all deal with, but rarely admit to. We live in a society that demands perfection, punctuality, and constant productivity. But what if we leaned into the chaos instead?

## The Coffee Addiction & Morning Rage Epidemic

It starts small. Do you hate everyone before coffee? You’re not alone. A hilarious self-help satire that finally explains morning rage. You tell yourself it's just this once. But soon, it becomes a lifestyle. And you know what? That's okay. Because trying to be perfect is exhausting, and quite frankly, boring.

Imagine a world where we celebrated our flaws instead of hiding them. Where "Coffee first. Humanity later." wasn't just a funny saying, but a badge of honor.

## Why Satire is the Best Medicine

When life gets overwhelming, humor is our best defense mechanism. Laughing at our own struggles takes the power away from them. It makes the scary stuff feels managed, and the annoying stuff feel ridiculous.

That's the core philosophy behind my latest book, **[Why Do I Hate Everyone Before Coffee](/books/why-do-i-hate-everyone-before-coffee/)**.

## A Deep Dive into Why Do I Hate Everyone Before Coffee

This isn't your standard self-help book that tells you to drink more water and journal your feelings (though, hydration is important). This is a **parody guide** designed to make you laugh until your stomach hurts.

In this book, we explore:

1.  **The Absurdity of Modern Life:** Why do we do the things we do?
2.  **Sarcastic Solutions:** Terrible advice that somehow makes sense.
3.  **Relatable Misery:** Knowing that you are not alone in your Coffee Addiction & Morning Rage struggles.

## Why You Should Read It

If you've ever felt seen by a meme, this book is for you. It's affordable, it's funny, and it's cheaper than therapy. Plus, it makes a great gift for that one friend who really needs to hear this message (you know the one).

Stop taking life so seriously. Grab a copy, pour a drink (or coffee), and enjoy the absurdity.
