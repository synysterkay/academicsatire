Let's be honest. **Time Blindness & Lateness** is something we all deal with, but rarely admit to. We live in a society that demands perfection, punctuality, and constant productivity. But what if we leaned into the chaos instead?

## The Time Blindness & Lateness Epidemic

It starts small. Ever started getting ready two hours early only to end up ten minutes late? Welcome to the definitive parody self-help guide for the chronically late. You tell yourself it's just this once. But soon, it becomes a lifestyle. And you know what? That's okay. Because trying to be perfect is exhausting, and quite frankly, boring.

Imagine a world where we celebrated our flaws instead of hiding them. Where "The definitive parody self-help guide for the chronically late." wasn't just a funny saying, but a badge of honor.

## Why Satire is the Best Medicine

When life gets overwhelming, humor is our best defense mechanism. Laughing at our own struggles takes the power away from them. It makes the scary stuff feels managed, and the annoying stuff feel ridiculous.

That's the core philosophy behind my latest book, **[How To Be Late Even When You Start Early](/books/how-to-be-late-even-when-you-start-early/)**.
