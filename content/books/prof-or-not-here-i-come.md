  ## Chapter 1: The Email That Started It All

  It was 7:43 AM on a Tuesday when I received the email that would change everything. Not because it contained groundbreaking news or a life-altering opportunity, but because it was the 47th email that week about the faculty parking lot redistribution initiative.

  "Dear Colleagues," it began, as if we were indeed colleagues and not prisoners of the same fluorescent-lit purgatory.

  I stared at my screen, coffee growing cold, wondering when exactly my career had devolved from "passionate educator changing lives" to "person who has opinions about parking space allocation."

  The email continued for seventeen paragraphs. Seventeen. About parking.

  That's when I knew: I needed to write this all down. Not for posterity, not for academic publication, but because if I didn't laugh about this, I would cry. And crying in your office is frowned upon unless you're a graduate student, in which case it's practically required.

  So here we are. Welcome to the absurdist circus that is academic life, where the coffee is bad, the meetings are endless, and the parking is always, always, someone else's fault...

## About This Book

**Prof or not, here I come!** is the satirical comedy that finally says what every academic has been thinking but was too afraid to put in their tenure portfolio.

Follow our unnamed narrator—a professor of indeterminate discipline at a university of questionable reputation—as they navigate the treacherous waters of:

- **Faculty meetings** that could have been emails (which could have been nothing)
- **Committee assignments** that multiply like academic rabbits
- **Student emails** that begin with "I know I missed the last three weeks, but..."
- **The eternal quest** for the mythical good parking spot
- **Department politics** that make Game of Thrones look like a children's show

### Why Readers Love It

This isn't just a book—it's a survival guide wrapped in comedy wrapped in the bitter tears of anyone who's ever had to explain why their office hours are, in fact, posted on the syllabus.

Whether you're a tenured professor, an adjunct warrior, a graduate student questioning your life choices, or simply someone who's ever wondered what really goes on behind those ivy-covered walls, this book is for you.

### What Critics Are Saying

> "A masterpiece of academic satire." — *The Chronicle of Higher Laughter*

> "I felt personally attacked on every page. Five stars." — *Anonymous Department Chair*

> "Finally, someone explains why faculty meetings are the way they are. The answer is: no one knows." — *Adjunct Life Magazine*

### Perfect For

- Professors who need a laugh between grading sessions
- Graduate students who need hope (or at least humor)
- Anyone who's ever attended a meeting that should have been an email
- Former academics who escaped and want to remember why
- Family members who want to understand why their academic loved one is always tired

### A Note From the Author

Writing this book was cheaper than therapy and more effective than screaming into the void of my office. If even one person reads this and feels less alone in the beautiful absurdity of academic life, then the 47 faculty meetings I attended while writing it were almost worth it.

Almost.

*— Prof Y Not*
